# Building shared lemon libs## WindowsI've used the graphical cmake tool, but it should be similarly possible to use msys2+conemu or something like that. 1. Extract the lemon source code, inside create two folders: build_win32 and build_win641. Open cmake-gui1. Set the source directory to the new lemon folder, and the binaries folder to build_win641. Press "configure" in the bottom left, select "VS 14/64bit" as generator1. Press "generate" to generate the project files1. Open LEMON.sln in the build folder1. Select RelWithDbgSymbols (or just release) and build1. If all goes well, you have `buid_xxx\lemon\RelWithDebInfo\lemon.lib`. copy it to `libs\lemon\lib\vs\(Win32|x64)`1. Now build again with the Debug configuration, and copy the resulting lib file to lemonD.lib1. Now repeat the whole process for 32 bit (the cmake generator is just called VS14, without any bitness information)## OSXUnzip the source, then in terminal: 	mkdir build_osx	cd build_osx	cmake ..	make all	find . -name "*.a" 	This should be good enough for a start. Making fat libs is "as always" (build both, then combine with lipo). ## HeadersThe headers can be copied over "as is", there's one tiny change needed in config.h. Look at the bottom where pthread vs. win32 threads is decided, and replace it with: 	#ifdef _WIN32	#define LEMON_USE_WIN32_THREADS 1	#else	#define LEMON_USE_PTHREAD 1	#endif
